# YoLunch
A web app that helps Coding Dojo students to form a group or join already-formed groups for lunch and dinner. 

Information about car-availability is included in each user so that each group could have at least one driver. Users 

could always register new restaurants with addresses and google map API automatically create markings on the map 

where reviews written by users are also displayed. Also provide reminder service via texting using Twilio API. Teamed 
up with 3 other developers. Wrote backend logic regarding controller, model, database and interaction between 

controllers and views including Google Map API. 

Technologies used: CodeIgniter, SQL Workbench, Google Map API, Twilio API, Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Git, GitHub


** Code in github is just the portion that I worked on. Twilio Texting functionality and frontend that were worked by other teammates are not included, since in the process of merging everything with frontend, codes and file structure got really messy. **
